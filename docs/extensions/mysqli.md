# mysqli Extension

Status: boundary only.

`mysqli_connect`, `mysqli_real_connect`, `mysqli_get_server_info`,
`mysqli_report`, and `mysqli_init` are currently visible through
`function_exists()`, `is_callable()`, dynamic string-valued function lookup,
and native function-table introspection so WordPress' early database startup
paths can move to the next real bootstrap blocker.

`mysqli_report($mode)` accepts the current WordPress startup mode
`MYSQLI_REPORT_OFF` and the common PHP 8 strict mode combination
`MYSQLI_REPORT_ERROR | MYSQLI_REPORT_STRICT`, records the mode, and returns
`true`. Report-mode warning/error routing is not implemented.

`mysqli_init()` returns a placeholder `mysqli` object with `connect_errno = 0`
and `connect_error = null`. It is an object-shape compatibility boundary, not a
host connection or real mysqli handle.

`mysqli_real_connect($handle, ...)` accepts the current WordPress startup call
shape for that placeholder object, writes `connect_errno = 0` and
`connect_error = null`, and returns `true`. It is deterministic fake success
for bootstrap exploration only. It does not open sockets, authenticate,
select a database, negotiate charset, or produce real mysqli connection state.

`mysqli_get_server_info($handle)` accepts the placeholder object and returns
`8.0.0-phpc-placeholder`, a deterministic fake server string used by
WordPress' `wpdb::db_version()` guard. It does not query a server or reflect
real connection metadata.

Calling `mysqli_connect(...)` is still a stable unsupported runtime boundary:

```text
unsupported call mysqli_connect(): mysqli/database connections are not implemented in the current subset
```

No real mysqli extension behavior is implemented yet: no host connections, no
real resources or connected objects beyond the placeholder shape, no real
server metadata, no queries, no result sets, no escaping, no charset handling,
no errors/warnings, no transactions, no configuration beyond the current
report-mode flag, no PDO bridge, and no native database lowering.
